# Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Pygame library in Python. The game features two paddles and a ball that bounces between them. The player's objective is to prevent the ball from hitting their side of the screen while trying to hit the ball past their opponent's paddle.

## Prerequisites
Before running the game, you must have the following software installed:
```
Python 3.x
Pygame
```

## Running the Game
To run the game, navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
```
python pong.py
```

This will launch the game in a Pygame window.

## Playing the Game
The game is controlled using the following keys:

```
Player 1 (left side):
W - move the paddle up
S - move the paddle down
Player 2 (right side):
UP - move the paddle up
DOWN - move the paddle down
```

## Acknowledgments
This game was inspired by the classic Pong game, which was first released by Atari in 1972. The Pygame library was used to create the game window and handle user input.
